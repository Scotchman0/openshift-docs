= About EUS-to-EUS updates

Every even-numbered minor version of {product-title}, including 4.10 and 4.12, is an Extended Update Support (EUS) version. However, because Kubernetes design mandates serial minor version updates, you cannot directly update from one EUS version to the next. You must first update to the each z-stream release of the odd-numbered minor version before you can proceed to the target EUS version.

Before beginning an EUS-to-EUS update, you must:

* Pause worker nodes' machine config pools before you start an EUS-to-EUS update so that the workers are not rebooted twice. 

* Disable automatic workload updates before you begin the update process. This is to prevent {VirtProductName} from migrating or evicting your virtual machines (VMs) until you update to your target EUS version.

[NOTE]
====
By default, {VirtProductName} automatically updates workloads, such as the `virt-launcher` pod, when you update the {VirtProductName} Operator. You can configure this behavior in the `spec.workloadUpdateStrategy` stanza of the `HyperConverged` custom resource.
